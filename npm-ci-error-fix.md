# npm ci Error - Missing package-lock.json

The error occurs because `npm ci` requires both package.json and package-lock.json files to be present and in sync, but the package-lock.json file is missing from the workspace.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Delete the existing node_modules directory (if it exists):
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
```

2. Run npm install to generate a new package-lock.json file and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. After this is done, you can use `npm ci` for future installations.

The difference between `npm install` and `npm ci`:
- `npm install` can modify package-lock.json
- `npm ci` requires package-lock.json and package.json to be in sync and will not modify them
- `npm ci` is typically used in CI/CD environments for more consistent installations

Your package.json shows the following dependencies that will be installed:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "@aws-amplify/ui-react": "^5.0.0",
    "aws-amplify": "^5.0.0",
    "react-icons": "^4.12.0"
  }
}
```
