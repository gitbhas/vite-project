# NPM Version Fix

The Vite configuration loading issue in CodeBuild was resolved by:

1. Downgrading Vite from v5.x to v4.5.x for better Node.js version compatibility
   - Vite 5.x requires Node.js 18+
   - Vite 4.x works with Node.js 14.18+ which is more likely to be available in CodeBuild

2. Using a CommonJS-style configuration in vite.config.js
   - Removed "type": "module" from package.json
   - Using require() instead of import statements
   - Added error handling for better debugging

3. Updated tsconfig.node.json to use Node.js-style module resolution

These changes ensure better compatibility with the CodeBuild environment which may be using an older version of Node.js.
